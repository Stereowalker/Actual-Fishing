This mod changes the game's fishing mechanics to behave more realistically. A few things to note that this mod does
1) You can no longer get fish in item form. You can still get treasure or junk when the hook goes into the water. In most cases, you'll get nothing
2) Your hook now lures in fish. Some will come and some won't, it all depends on how the fishies are feeling
3) When a fish approaches your hook, there is a chance that they'll bite it. When they do, your hook will stay attached to the fish
4) When you reel in fish, you get fish. If you want junk or treasure, you're going to have to fish the vanilla way
5) This mod will not generate or create fish for you to catch, that's not realistic. If you want fish, you'll have to look for a body of water that already has fish in it
